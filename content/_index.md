Welcome to the **Bridges Chiral Network**. This terminal contains data on deliveries, porter logs, and chiral network statusâ€”essential information for those brave enough to traverse the fractured landscape.

We deliver cargo to rebuild connections. The Death Stranding separated us, but we're determined to reconnect society strand by strand, one porter at a time. Every package delivered brings humanity closer together.

> "The whole wide world will be yours to explore. You can go wherever you want. Even the moon."

The **reconstruction** continues. Maybe we'll find meaning not in the destinations we reach, but in the connections we forge along the way.
