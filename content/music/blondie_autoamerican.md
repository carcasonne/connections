"Autoamerican" represents Blondie at their most adventurous and eclectic, an ambitious artistic statement that pushed far beyond the boundaries of new wave. Recorded in Los Angeles rather than their native New York, the album opens with "Europa," an orchestral instrumental that immediately signals the band's determination to defy expectations. This experimental approach extends throughout the album, which incorporates reggae, rap, disco, jazz, and even Broadway show tunes into its stylistic mix.

The album yielded two of Blondie's most significant hits: their cover of The Paragons' "The Tide Is High," which added horn arrangements and strings to the reggae original, and the groundbreaking "Rapture," which became the first #1 U.S. single to feature rap vocals. Debbie Harry's rap verse, referencing hip-hop pioneer Fab Five Freddy (who appeared in the video), created a crucial bridge between the downtown New York art scene, emerging hip-hop culture, and mainstream pop audiences.

Beyond these hits, "Autoamerican" features fascinating experiments like the film noir jazz of "Here's Looking at You," the Lerner and Loewe cover "Follow Me," and the rockabilly-influenced "T-Birds." While this stylistic diversity alienated some fans and critics at the time, "Autoamerican" has been reassessed as a visionary work that anticipated the genre-fluid approach of contemporary pop. It stands as Blondie's most ambitious artistic statementâ€”a kaleidoscopic tour of American musical forms filtered through their unique sensibility and Harry's charismatic presence.
