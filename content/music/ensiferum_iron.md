The second and final album with founding vocalist Jari Mäenpää (before he departed to form Wintersun), "Iron" represents Ensiferum at their most focused and potent. Building on the foundation of their debut, the band refines their folk-infused melodic death metal approach with more complex compositions and improved production. The title track perfectly encapsulates their ability to combine aggressive metal with folk sensibilities, while "Tale of Revenge" showcases their talent for crafting epic narratives within a song structure.

"Iron" stands as a landmark in folk metal, striking the perfect balance between accessibility and technical prowess. The clean choral vocals, particularly on "LAI LAI HEI," contrast effectively with Mäenpää's harsh delivery, creating dynamic shifts that enhance the album's epic quality. Markus Toivonen and Mäenpää's guitar work is exceptional throughout, with intricate harmonies and melodic leads that evoke both Finnish folk traditions and classic heavy metal influences.

Despite being nearly two decades old, "Iron" remains a blueprint for effective folk metal that avoids the genre's potential pitfalls of gimmickry or excess. Its influence extends beyond the folk metal scene, impacting melodic death metal and pagan metal movements as well. For many fans, this album represents the definitive Ensiferum sound, capturing the band at a creative peak before their stylistic evolution in subsequent releases.
