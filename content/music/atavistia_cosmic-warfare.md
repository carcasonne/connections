I didn't really discover this band before finding this album, and it too was by complete chance. I was just scrolling through the Angry Metal Guy blog and find the [review with an awesome album cover](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/atavistia-cosmic-warfare-review/). It's like Wintersun, so why not give it a shot? Well, I didn't really like it at first. Too much stuff going on and the vocals, even when clean, are impossible to decipher. But I guess a melody or two stuck inside my head, and made me listen to the songs from time to time. And at one point it just hit, and I really fell in love with the songs. Especially the later part of the album with »Divine Destruction« and »Forgotten Silence« really hit the right spots for me.

Funny when I think back, most of my favorite albums are pieces that I did not really enjoy the first time but grew to love: Wintersun, Megadeth, Blondie. I think music in many ways need to be heard in the right mood, and this unlocks something deeper about listening to it. No matter what kind of song it is, it's really about which kind of emotional connection we make to the piece.
