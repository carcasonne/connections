One of the first albums recorded on digital equipment, Brothers in Arms became one of the best-selling albums of all time with over 30 million copies sold. The album perfectly captures the mid-80s zeitgeist while still maintaining the band's musical integrity. The title track is a moving anti-war ballad, showcasing Knopfler's ability to combine personal emotion with political commentary.
