A groundbreaking masterpiece that cemented Dylan's transition from folk to rock. Opening with "Like a Rolling Stone," a revolutionary six-minute epic that changed popular music forever, Highway 61 Revisited merges blues structures with surrealist lyrics, electric instrumentation, and Dylan's increasingly sneering vocal delivery. The album represents the sound of tradition being blown apart and reassembled in startling new forms.
