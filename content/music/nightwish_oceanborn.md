Nightwish's sophomore album marked a significant evolution in their sound, moving away from the more folk-influenced debut toward a fully realized symphonic metal approach. Tarja Turunen's classically trained soprano soars over Marco Hietala's harsh vocals and Tuomas Holopainen's keyboard-driven compositions, creating a striking contrast that would define the band's early sound. The album's fantasy themes and dramatic arrangements established Nightwish as pioneers in the symphonic metal genre.

"Walking in the Air" showcases the band's ability to transform existing work (in this case, Howard Blake's piece from "The Snowman") into something uniquely their own, while original compositions like "Stargazers" and "The Pharaoh Sails to Orion" demonstrate their ambition to merge classical influences with heavy metal intensity. Oceanborn represents the moment Nightwish found their distinctive voice in the metal landscape.
