"Time I" arrived after an eight-year wait following Wintersun's debut, and the ambition behind its delayed release is immediately apparent. Released in 2012, this first half of Jari Mäenpää's planned "Time" duology represents a quantum leap in scope and complexity, transforming Wintersun from a melodic death metal project into something approaching symphonic metal art.

The album's production is extraordinarily dense and layered, with hundreds of orchestral and choral tracks meticulously arranged to create a vast, cosmic soundscape. This complexity famously contributed to the album's lengthy production time, as Mäenpää pushed against technical limitations to realize his expansive vision. The result is a work of staggering depth that reveals new details with each listen.

"Sons of Winter and Stars," divided into four movements, stands as the album's towering achievement—an epic 13-minute journey that encompasses furious blast beats, soaring clean vocals, folk-inspired melodies, and orchestral grandeur. "Land of Snow and Sorrow" demonstrates Wintersun's evolved songwriting with its emotional crescendos and atmospheric depth, while the title track "Time" provides a fitting conclusion with its philosophical themes and musical complexity.

Thematically, "Time I" explores cosmic concepts of time, existence, and nature, with lyrics that often take a philosophical or spiritual perspective. This conceptual approach perfectly complements the music's expansive sound. While some fans of the debut's more straightforward approach were initially challenged by this evolution, "Time I" has been embraced as a visionary work that pushed the boundaries of what metal could achieve in terms of orchestration and production complexity.
