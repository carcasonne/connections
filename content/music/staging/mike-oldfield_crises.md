Released during Oldfield's commercial peak, "Crises" perfectly balances his progressive instrumental compositions with accessible pop sensibilities. The title track is a 20-minute masterpiece of evolving themes and instrumental virtuosity, while "Moonlight Shadow" became one of his biggest hits with Maggie Reilly's haunting vocals. The album showcases Oldfield's unique talent for creating atmospheric soundscapes that feel both expansive and intimate, with his trademark guitar work weaving through layers of synthesizers and percussion.

The album's exploration of duality - between light and shadow, complexity and simplicity, commercial and experimental - creates a fascinating tension throughout. Jon Anderson of Yes contributes vocals on "In High Places," adding another dimension to this multifaceted work that continues to reward careful listening decades after its release.
