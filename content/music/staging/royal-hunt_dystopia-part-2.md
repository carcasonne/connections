Coming of discovering Royal Hunt's amazing [Paradox](/music/royal-hunt-paradox/), I was being recommended some of their songs by the youtube algorithm. The song »Scream Of Anger« began autoplaying while I wasn't paying attention, but once the song got started I had to look up and check what the name of this awesome song was. »Scream Of Anger« is a great starting point for the album, because it is the top top song of the album, and one of the best produced by the band in total. The main melody is etched into my brain, and I love how it is teased in the beginning with the violins. From the rest of the albums »Thorn In My Heart« is my second favorite due to its catchy chorus, but the rest of the album falls a bit flat and I have honestly not listened much to it.
