"Once in a Long, Long While..." finds Low Roar expanding their sonic palette while maintaining the haunting atmospheric quality that defined their earlier work. This third album introduces more pronounced electronic elements and rhythmic components, with producer Andrew Scheps (who's worked with Adele and Red Hot Chili Peppers) helping to create a more polished sound without sacrificing the band's distinctive melancholic atmosphere. The album was partly inspired by Ryan Karazija's experiences in Poland, where he spent time after his years in Iceland.

Lead single "Don't Be So Serious" exemplifies the album's evolution, building from acoustic guitar foundations to incorporate driving electronic beats and lush synth textures. "Bones" further demonstrates this balance, with its pulsing rhythm section supporting delicate guitar work and Karazija's ethereal vocals. Throughout the album, the songs explore themes of distance, connection, and the passage of time, often expressed through poetic, fragmented lyrics that create emotional impressions rather than literal narratives.

What distinguishes this album is how it navigates between accessibility and experimentation, between hope and melancholy. Songs like "Give Me an Answer" have an almost anthemic quality despite their introspective nature, while tracks like "Poznan" and "St. Eriksplan" (named after locations in Poland and Sweden) create immersive soundscapes that reflect the album's international genesis. "Once in a Long, Long While..." stands as a testament to Low Roar's ability to create music that feels simultaneously intimate and vast, personal and universal.
