Once represents Nightwish at their commercial peak during the Tarja Turunen era, featuring full orchestral arrangements from the London Philharmonic Orchestra that elevated their symphonic metal sound to new heights. "Nemo" became their breakthrough international hit, while "Ghost Love Score" stands as one of their most ambitious compositionsâ€”a near 10-minute epic that has become a cornerstone of their live performances.

The album marks the band's most polished production to date, with tracks like "Planet Hell" and "Wish I Had an Angel" showcasing a heavier, more accessible approach while maintaining their symphonic roots. "Creek Mary's Blood" incorporates Native American influences with contributions from John Two-Hawks, demonstrating the band's willingness to expand their musical palette. As the final album with Tarja before her controversial dismissal, Once captures Nightwish at a pivotal moment, combining commercial accessibility with artistic ambition in a way that would influence countless symphonic metal acts to follow.
