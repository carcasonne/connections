I discovered this album randomly. I was reading a forum post saying that among Danish bands Wuthering Heights and Royal Hunt were the most criminally underrated. Since Wuthering Heights is one of my favorite bands of all time, and holds such nice memories for me, I was intrigued and decided to check out this newly discovered boomer band. I found the album »Paradox« on youtube and put it on. It took a bit of time to catch on, but the transition from »River of Pain« to »Tearing Down the World« blew me away (the intro of »River of Pain« is stunning). The album only gets better with these medium-long songs between 5 and 7 minutes, with the longest being »Time Will Tell«. The melodies are so good, the instruments are on point for this 'floaty' atmosphere that manages to be very relaxing and assertive at the same time.
