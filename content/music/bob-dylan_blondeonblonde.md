Rock's first double album and the culmination of Dylan's mid-60s electric trilogy. Recorded with Nashville session musicians, Blonde on Blonde achieves what Dylan described as "that thin, wild mercury sound" - a perfect fusion of poetic surrealism, blues structures, and rock energy. The album concludes with the 11-minute "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands," an epic love song that occupied an entire side of vinyl and pushed the boundaries of what a rock song could be.
