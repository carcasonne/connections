The long-awaited "Time II" finally emerged in 2017, though not in the form most fans expected. After years of production challenges and technical limitations that prevented completion of the planned direct sequel to "Time I," Jari Mäenpää and Wintersun pivoted to create "The Forest Seasons"—a conceptual work that many consider the spiritual successor to the Time saga and is commonly referred to as "Time II" among the fanbase.

This ambitious project consists of four epic tracks, each representing a season and ranging from 12-14 minutes in length. The album was created as part of a crowdfunding campaign for Wintersun's personal studio, allowing Mäenpää the technical freedom to realize his increasingly complex musical visions without the constraints that had delayed previous releases.

"The Forest That Weeps (Summer)" opens the album with vibrant energy and lush orchestration, while "Loneliness (Winter)" returns to the icy atmospheres that have defined Wintersun's sound from the beginning. "Eternal Darkness (Autumn)" showcases perhaps the album's most progressive elements with its shifting moods and experimental structures, and "Awaken From the Dark Slumber (Spring)" completes the cycle with themes of rebirth and renewal.

Musically, the album continues the orchestral complexity of "Time I" while incorporating elements reminiscent of the debut's more direct approach. The seasonal concept provides a framework for exploring different emotional territories within Wintersun's symphonic metal universe. While technically not the direct narrative sequel fans had anticipated, "The Forest Seasons" delivers the scope and ambition they expected, further cementing Wintersun's reputation for creating immersive metal experiences that blur the boundaries between extreme metal, classical composition, and natural soundscapes.
