Considered by many critics to be their artistic peak, Making Movies features longer, more complex compositions with cinematic qualities. The production by Jimmy Iovine brings a new level of clarity and punch to the band's sound. Mark Knopfler's storytelling reaches new heights with "Romeo and Juliet," which paints a modern urban love story with poignant imagery.
