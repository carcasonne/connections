Found a path through the northern ridge that avoids both BT territory and MULE scanners. The route requires traversing several steep gradients, but with proper equipment and cargo distribution, it's manageable.

## Terrain Analysis

The first third of the route follows a shallow riverbed, providing stable footing but minimal cover. Timefall shelter available under rock formations at coordinates N-023, E-156.

Middle section requires climbing equipment - anchors have been placed at critical junctures. Not recommended during active timefall due to slippery surfaces.

Final approach to Mountain Knot City has frequent BT presence. Holding breath and moving slowly is advised. BB response was elevated throughout this section.

## Resource Deposits

Discovered crystals at the following locations:
- N-032, E-159 (moderate yield)
- N-035, E-157 (high yield)
- N-038, E-160 (low yield, high quality)

## Final Notes

This route saves approximately 2.4 km compared to the previous path, but requires more stamina and equipment management. Energy consumption is approximately 30% higher, but time savings make it worthwhile for priority deliveries.

Keep on keeping on.
