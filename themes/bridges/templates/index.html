            <p>welcome to my corner of the wired. this is where i archive the fragments that matter - books that shaped my thinking, articles worth preserving, links to signal among the noise.</p>
            
            <p>the internet feels increasingly ephemeral. platforms disappear, links rot, algorithms decide what survives. this site is my small act of resistance against that entropy. everything here persists as long as i choose to maintain it.</p>

            <p>personal reading log. tracking what i've consumed, what i'm working through, what got abandoned. no social aspects, no algorithmic recommendations - just honest accounting of my literary wanderings.</p>

            <p>this site exists because i believe in digital ownership. not the artificial scarcity of NFTs or the gamification of streaming platforms, but actual possession of files, control over access, independence from corporate whims.</p>
            
            <p>everything here is self-hosted, self-maintained, deliberately small-scale. it's not optimized for growth or engagement metrics. it's optimized for persistence and personal utility.</p>
            
            <p>take what you like, discard the rest, move on. same philosophy applies to the books, the links, the ideas. nothing here claims to be definitive or complete.</p>
